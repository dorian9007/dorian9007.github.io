      <description>The academic paper based on my masters thesis and research made during my work with the OSwinds research team of the Aristotle Unicersity of Thessaloniki got published in Springers&#39; Internationa Journal of Information Security by the name &amp;ldquo;DeTRACT a decentralized, transparent, immutable and open PKI certificate framework&amp;rdquo;.
Thanks to the team, George Vlahavas, Konstantinos Karasavvas &amp;amp; Athena Vakali.
Abstract Public key infrastructure (PKI) is widely used over the Internet to secure and to encrypt communication among parties.</description>

      <description>This repo contains possible implementations for cross chain transactions platforms, that need support for multiple cryptocurrencies. Due to this fact several ways can be used to implement cross chain transactions. Some of the methods are described bellow, with PoC code in the folders of this repo.

      <description>This is a project developed during my blockchain research in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
This project includes decentralized voting capabilities to support the decentralized addition of new organizations in the final Plastic Twist network (Horizon 2020 European Project). It uses the blockchain technology to exploit its capabilities and especially the Ethereum Blockchain, to be easily applicable to the initial system created by Almerys.

      <description>Presentation and paper proceeding in the 4th Olympus International Conference on Supply Chains (14-15 September 2018, Katerini), on the topic &amp;ldquo;Traceability Decentralization in Supply Chain Management Using Blockchain Technologies&amp;rdquo;. Co-author Christos Sermpinis.
Abstract With the increase of web users and applications with real time requests, the ability to identify, track and trace elements of a product as it moves in the supply chain is deemed necessary, and for many industries is even mandated by national or international regulations.</description>

      <description>My masters thesis, supervised by Athena Vakali, was based on blockchain technologies with the title “PKI Decentralization Using Blockchain Technologies”.
Abstract The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is used widely on the Internet in order to certify the identity of users, and as a result encrypt the communication between two parties and make it more secure. From this model, multiple problems can arise, most of them due to its centralized nature. In the past, there have been cases of Certificate Authorities distributing rogue certificates that resulted in attacks, targeting users of the system.</description>
