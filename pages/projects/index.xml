      <description>Title: Improper Input Validation leads to buffer overflow in dlt-daemon
Date: 12/05/2021
CVE-ID: CVE-2021-29507
Author: Thomas Sermpinis
Versions: 2.10.0 &amp;lt; version &amp;lt;= 2.18.6
Package URL: https://github.com/GENIVI/dlt-daemon/
Tested on: dlt-daemon 2.18.6
The dlt-daemon includes a configuration file load functionality (-c) which is vulnerable to a buffer overflow vulnerability and allows a malicious user to supply a specially crafted configuration file which results in a segmentation fault after improper validation of the file content.</description>

      <description>Title: Stack based buffer overflow while parsing JSON file in Aleth C++ Ethereum client
Date: 11/01/2021
CVE-ID: CVE-2020-26800
Author: Thomas Sermpinis
Versions: &amp;lt;= 1.8.0
Package URL: https://github.com/ethereum/aleth
Tested on: Aleth C++ Ethereum Client 1.8.0
An attacker can supply a specially crafted config.json file, consisting of 3764 left square brackets or more, which results in segmentation fault by the application. This immediately results in Denial of Service, and with more advanced exploitation it can have further implications, with higher severity security issues.</description>

      <description>Title: File Type Restriction Bypass in Socket.io-file NPM module
Date: 31/07/2020
CVE-ID: CVE-2020-24807
Author: Thomas Sermpinis
Versions: &amp;lt;= 2.0.31
Package URL: -
Tested on: node v10.19.0, Socket.io-file v2.0.31, socket.io v2.3.0
All versions of socket.io-file are vulnerable to a file restriction bypass. The validation for valid file types only happens on the client-side, which allows an attacker to intercept the Websocket request post-validation and alter the name value to upload any file types.</description>

      <description>OSCEs have expert-level penetration testing skills. They have proven that they can craft their own exploits, execute attacks to compromise systems, and gain administrative access. The intense 48-hour exam also demonstrates that OSCEs have an above-average degree of persistence, determination, and ability to perform under pressure and can think outside the box to determine innovative ways of penetrating internal networks. An OSCE also has familiarity with more advanced protections like ASLR.</description>

Date: 18/05/2020
CVE-ID: 2020-15779
Author: Thomas Sermpinis
Versions: &amp;lt;= 2.0.31
Package URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io-file
Tested on: node v10.19.0, Socket.io-file v2.0.31, socket.io v2.3.0
All versions of socket.io-file are vulnerable to Path Traversal. The package fails to sanitize user input and uses it to generate the file upload paths. The socket.io-file::createFile message contains a name option that is passed directly to path.join(). It is possible to upload files to arbitrary folders on the server by sending relative paths on the name value, such as .</description>

Writing to this legend was a must for me, so I composed a really interesting story, describing how privacy concern can drive you crazy, how it can lead you to losing everything and a debate on what can anc cannot be the attitute of online entities in our modern world.</description>

      <description>Mi Notebook Pro by Xiaomi is a 15inch laptop which was widely adopted because of its good price/performance ratio. This made it a huge success and created a big community of hackers wanting to fix some minor issues that the laptop had, alongside adding new capabilities, like natevelly running MacOS.
I created a repo including all the available mods, and additional stuff I created for this device.

      <guid>https://cr0wtom.github.io/projects/pki-decentralization-using-blockchain-technologies/</guid>
      <description>My masters thesis, supervised by Athena Vakali, was based on blockchain technologies with the title “PKI Decentralization Using Blockchain Technologies”.
Abstract The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is used widely on the Internet in order to certify the identity of users, and as a result encrypt the communication between two parties and make it more secure. From this model, multiple problems can arise, most of them due to its centralized nature. In the past, there have been cases of Certificate Authorities distributing rogue certificates that resulted in attacks, targeting users of the system.</description>

      <description>My bachelors thesis, supervised by Dimitrios Folinas, was based on NFC and WMS technologies with the title “Integration of Near Field Communication into Warehouse Management Systems”.
Abstract (Greek) Στην παρούσα εργασία θα αναφερθούμε και θα εξετάσουμε μία καινοτόμο εφαρμογή που έχει να κάνει με την εφαρμογή της τεχνολογίας NFC, και παράλληλα της πολιτικής BYOD, στα συστήματα WMS. Τα κύρια σημεία που εξετάστηκαν είναι το αν υπάρχει ενδιαφέρον από τους εργαζομένους, όσο αναφορά την εφαρμογή ενός τέτοιου συστήματος στον χώρο εργασίας τους, και αν είναι δυνατή η ανάπτυξη ενός ολοκληρωμένου συστήματος με την προσθήκη των τεχνολογιών και πολιτικών που προτείνονται.</description>

      <description>For a couple of years I was constalty cooperating with DeltaHacker as a Magazine Editor for penetration testing and cyber security technical topics, with my nickname being Cr0wTom. I wrote 10 articles in total, but suddenly they exist only in Greek and you can find abstracts of the article in my blog, but you can also purchace all of DeltaHacker&amp;rsquo;s issues by their website.
DeltaHacker alongside my personal blog, can be considered my start in the security industry, my first steps and some really exciting times with people from the Greek hacking community that I really apreciate.</description>
