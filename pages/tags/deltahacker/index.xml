      <description>For a couple of years I was constalty cooperating with DeltaHacker as a Magazine Editor for penetration testing and cyber security technical topics, with my nickname being Cr0wTom. I wrote 10 articles in total, but suddenly they exist only in Greek and you can find abstracts of the article in my blog, but you can also purchace all of DeltaHacker&amp;rsquo;s issues by their website.
DeltaHacker alongside my personal blog, can be considered my start in the security industry, my first steps and some really exciting times with people from the Greek hacking community that I really apreciate.</description>
